# Rehabilitation System for Dysphagia in Children with Cerebral Palsy
This project proposes a novel rehabilitation system aimed at supporting children with cerebral palsy (CP) and dysphagia (chewing and swallowing difficulties). The proposed system integrates Electroencephalography (EEG), Electromyography (EMG), and Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) into a single, wearable cap-based device, supported by a gamified, child-friendly interface.
